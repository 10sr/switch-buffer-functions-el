;;; Commentary:

;; This package provides a hook variable
;; `post-command-current-buffer-changed-functions'.

;; This hook will be run when the current buffer has been changed after each
;; interactive command, i.e. `post-command-hook' is called.

;; When functions are hooked, they will be called with the previous buffer and
;; the current buffer.  For example, if you eval:

;; (add-hook 'post-command-current-buffer-changed-functions
;;           (lambda (prev cur) (message "%S -> %S" prev cur)))

;; then the message like "#<buffer *Messages*> -> #<buffer init.el<.emacs.d>>"
;; will be displayed to the echo area each time when you switch the current
;; buffer.

;;; Code:

;;;###autoload
(defvar post-command-current-buffer-changed-functions
  nil
  "A list of functions to be called when the current buffer has been changed.
Each is passed two arguent, the previous buffer and the current buffer.")

(defvar post-command-current-buffer-changed-functions--last-buffer
  nil
  "The last current buffer.")

;;;###autoload
(defun post-command-current-buffer-changed-functions-run ()
  "Run `post-command-current-buffer-changed-functions' if needed.

This function checks the result of `current-buffer', and run
`post-command-current-buffer-changed-functions' when it has been changed from
the last buffer.

This function should be hooked to `post-command-hook'."
  (unless (eq (current-buffer)
              post-command-current-buffer-changed-functions--last-buffer)
    (let ((current (current-buffer))
          (previous post-command-current-buffer-changed-functions--last-buffer))
      (setq post-command-current-buffer-changed-functions--last-buffer
            current)
      (run-hook-with-args 'post-command-current-buffer-changed-functions
                          current
                          previous))))
